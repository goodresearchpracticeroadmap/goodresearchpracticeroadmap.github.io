Welcome to the Good Research Practice (GRP) Roadmap. As researchers, it is our responsibility to follow good research
practices, which hugely benefit our work and research careers.

This ensures our research is transparent, high quality,
ethical, and impactful. As integrating GRPs can at times be challenging, this roadmap is designed to help researchers (
particularly early-career researchers) consider how to implement these practices at every research stage – planning,
doing and disseminating – of their work.

It outlines core themes relevant throughout your research journey, along with
themes specific to each project phase. This roadmap is extensive, covering many topics and signposting to many
resources.

**Please remember that you are not expected to tackle everything at once, but rather to refer to it as needed,
with this roadmap acting as a companion to support your journey into good practice**.{% endcapture %}
