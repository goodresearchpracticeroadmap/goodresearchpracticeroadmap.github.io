  - Plans for data sharing should ideally be made at the **start of the project**. 

  - Data should be **'as open as possible, as closed as necessary’** - note that you must check you have appropriate permissions to make your data open and that any identifying features of the data are removed/anonymised. 

  - Opening your data, code, and workflows to others means it can be **used, verified, critiqued, or improved independently**. This transparency makes your data and code more trustworthy and rigorous.  

  - Sharing an original dataset, particularly from a complex, large, or costly project is a great way to **facilitate further research**. When sharing data, consider the **FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets) data principles**.

The acronym FAIR is broken down as follows: F – Findable, represented by a magnifying glass icon; A – Accessible, illustrated with a hand clicking a button icon; I – Interoperable, shown using three interconnected gear icons; R – Reusable, depicted with a recycling symbol; Each principle is aligned with a corresponding black icon to visually reinforce its meaning." caption="FAIR data sharing.

  - Sharing data in this way and avoiding additional data collection is also a very effective way to **reduce research waste** (financial, material, or e.g. animal lives) 

  - However, be aware of any **restrictions and legal requirements around personal and sensitive data** and what you can and cannot share.  

    - Some data may be entirely unsuitable for sharing 

    - Some data may be able to be shared in its raw form 

    - Some data will need to undergo processing or removal of sensitive information before sharing is possible 

  - Ensure your data is **stored securely**, particularly for sensitive data. 

  - Data and code sharing is **viewed as important by some funders and journals**. Almost all will commend it, and some funders or journals may mandate it.

At the center is a digital document icon with a padlock symbol, suggesting data security. Dotted lines connect the document to multiple icons of users, some with key symbols (indicating access) and others with an X (indicating restricted access). A businessperson in a suit is visible in the background, with their finger touching the document icon, representing control or initiation of data sharing.." caption="Data Sharing.

- For sharing data, consider **different data repository options** (for personal or research group use, institute or institution use, use with external collaborators, or Open Access). Certain types of data  will have specific repositories for these cases.  

  - Always **annotate and carefully document** any data you share carefully.  

  - Different options may be available for **code sharing** to facilitate aspects such as collaboration or updates (e.g. GitHub). 

  - When sharing code, use **good coding practice, document your code carefully, and share it in a universally usable format**. Different standards may apply to certain use cases like for publication.  

  - Particularly for complex or important projects, consider **seeking out specialist training** (resources, workshops, seminars, practical courses) on data management and sharing, preferably before data collection takes place.
