{% include roadmap-zoom-title.html cssClass="good-reporting" title="Good reporting ensures clarity, accuracy, and transparency, enabling others to understand, evaluate, and replicate your research effectively.

### Report your research accurately and completely

- **Report any deviations** from your protocol, if you published one.
- Report your methods and results **clearly and comprehensively**.
- **Avoid poor practice** like selective reporting of outcomes or results or cherry-picking of results. You should aim to report all results relevant to your research questions, regardless of their significance and whether they confirm your hypotheses.
- **Report your findings, even if they refute your hypotheses** or are “null” results. Not doing so contributes to publication bias, and could lead to research waste, or distort findings of evidence syntheses like meta-analyses, exaggerating results.
- In quantitative research, be cautious about the **reporting and interpretation** of statistical results such as P-values.
- Ensure you properly **identify and declare any potential conflicts of interest** (e.g. financial, personal) that could affect the integrity of your work and affect research outcomes.
- Be careful to follow **appropriate procedures for referencing** and citing previous work (including formats like images and websites) to avoid plagiarism.
- Consider creating a **metadata template** you can complete for each experiment.

  

### Follow available reporting guidelines where applicable

- Use a system such as the [Equator Network](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/) to identify *specific reporting guidelines for your study type and research field*.
- Inform yourself on **reporting guidelines** in your field of research and in the broader research environment (these are often study type-specific), e.g.
  - For clinical trials, refer to [Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/).
  -	For animal research, refer to the [ARRIVE](https://arriveguidelines.org/arrive-guidelines) guidelines.
  - For studies such as systematic reviews, follow the [PRISMA](https://www.prisma-statement.org/prisma-2020-checklist) guidelines.
- Additionally, be aware of any **additional guidelines or standards** set out by your programme, institution, or funding body, and adhere to these as well. Be aware of any specific guidelines e.g. ,around using generative artificial intelligence (AI).
- Also follow [reporting standards for metadata](https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard), where applicable.
- **Ensure you adhere to these rigorously and completely**. Understand the items fully, fill in all required or recommended sections of any forms or sections, and follow any supporting guidelines available to ensure accuracy.
