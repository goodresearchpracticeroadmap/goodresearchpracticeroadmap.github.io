###Documenting your research thoroughly enables yourself and others to keep track of what has been done at any point, and later to verify and replicate your work###

  

  - Think about the **types of information** you'll need to record ahead of time e.g. ideas and plans, information about methods, recording experiments, recording results, recording how data were analysed, discussions with supervisors and collaborators.  

  - Document everything related to the data itself, about how it was collected, any data analysis done, and carefully store study metadata (see data collection and storage section below). 

  - Learn about [University policies](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/about/policies-and-regulations/research-data-policy) around research data.  

- For more complex projects, attend [training](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/research-data-service/research-data-training-skills) around **research data management**.  

  - **Consider lab book formats** and decide on a format/template with your research group and supervisors (e.g. electronic lab notebooks like [Rspace](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/research-data-service/during/open-research-tools/rspace-notebooks)). For multiple people working on the same project, having a universal system may be beneficial. 

  - Write a **data management plan** (e.g. using [DMPonline](https://dmponline.ed.ac.uk/?perform_check=false)) (see “prepare a data management plan” in the write plans section above). 

  - Learn about the importance of **documenting data** and learn more formal **organisational techniques**, e.g. adhering to metadata standards and preparing data dictionaries.
