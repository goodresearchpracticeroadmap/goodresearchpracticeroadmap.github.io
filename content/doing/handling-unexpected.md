  - Before or during your projects, you may want to **consider what could theoretically go wrong** and have **contingency plans** in mind for when these eventualities do occur. Discuss these with people involved, including your supervisor or line manager. 

  - Be aware of your initial research objectives and the type of data or results you planned to or thought you would achieve, so that you are able to **determine when something is indeed unexpected**, as early on as possible. 

  - If something unexpected happens, **document this carefully**.

  - **ALWAYS speak up if you notice something unexpected or an error**; to not do so would be a breach of research integrity principles. 

  - Be prepared to have to **alter your plans for any dependent projects and/or results dissemination**. You may have to repeat experiments, test different factors in a separate experiment, do a follow-up experiment, or abandon this experiment altogether.  

  - While some errors are unavoidable, others may come from mistakes you or a colleague make. Remember, **mistakes do happen and are a natural part of research**. We can often fix them and almost always learn from them.  

  - Some research may produce **negative findings**, i.e., the thing that you were testing did not have an effect or had an opposite effect to what you expected. 

    - Check your methods and results, making sure that e.g. you had **appropriate controls in place**, and they behaved as expected, or rule out equipment/recording errors 

    - It is important to determine the **source of this discrepancy**, i.e., why you didn’t find what you expected. This finding could be interesting or important and/or help avoid others repeating the same thing.  

    - Remember that negative findings or “null results” are **not always a sign of an error or mistake** and can be an important finding, including failure to replicate a study.  

    - You should endeavour to **publish any important negative findings**, even if they seem less enticing or exciting than what you were expecting or than “positive” results. This helps avoid **publication bias and research waste**.  

    - Avenues for publishing this research may differ, but **publishing negative findings is just as important as publishing positive ones**.
