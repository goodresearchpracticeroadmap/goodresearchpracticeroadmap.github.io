**Following proper procedures for data analysis and following appropriate methods ensure the validity and reliability of your findings, leading to credible and reproducible results.**

 
  - **Follow any analysis methods planned in any protocols or preregistrations**, and if deviations are required, **document these**. 

  - You should always make sure any data analysis is **replicable and reproducible** – be sure you know and record exactly what you did and how you did it.  

  - If using specific software for data analysis, always **record the exact software versions and settings used**, and keep a record of the exact steps you followed.  

  - If your analyses change over time, **do not completely rewrite any analysis records or code** but rather add to it or make a copy of your analysis script – this ensures you still have a record of earlier analyses, and don’t lose any important information. 

  - If using coding/programming, follow steps to **ensure your code is reproducible**: use version control, good coding practices, upload to repositories, and have proper procedures in place for updating, overwriting, or collaborating on code.   

  - If doing quantitative research, engage in appropriate **statistical training** and ensure you understand the statistical tests you are using, and which tests or checks are **suitable to the type of data** you're analysing – this should ideally have been addressed in the “planning” stage of your project. If needed, seek out help with analysis from an expert, statistician, or data analysis group. 

  - For quantitative data, consider whether you need to perform any **data checks** before including data in analysis e.g., tests normality, sphericity, homogeneity, or checking for outliers etc. – these should have ideally been planned in any protocols.  

  - Understand the importance of **good data presentation** and consider ways to incorporate these practices: graphic and figure design, types of plots available, slide design. Scope out any helpful guides and/or tools that may help you achieve this. Ensure your data presentation is accessible, eg. use colour-blind friendly presentation.
