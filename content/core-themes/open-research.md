**Open Research is an important movement in research to make it accessible, inclusive, equitable, and sustainable. It is underpinned by principles such as transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration.**  




**Familiarise yourself with the concept of Open Research**

- Open Research is a movement which aims to make scientific research (including publications, data, physical samples, and software) and its dissemination **accessible** to all levels of society, amateur or professional. It also ensures that the production of that knowledge itself is **inclusive, equitable and sustainable**. 

- Learn about the **University’s initiatives** around reproducibility and Open Research, e.g. [IAD Open Research hub](https://support-for-researchers.ed.ac.uk/getting-started/doing-research/open-research), library resources/courses (e.g. [open research initiatives](https://library.ed.ac.uk/research-support/open-research), Edinburgh Open Research Initiative ([EORI](https://edopenresearch.wordpress.com/),  [ReproducibiliTea](https://reproducibilitea.org/). 

- Learn about **wider national or international open research initiatives**: [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/), [UK Reproducibility Network](https://www.ukrn.org/), [FAIR data](https://fairsharing.org/). 

- Read [relevant publications](https://rpt-rl.netlify.app/) on open research and/or join journal clubs on the theme (e.g. ReproducibiliTea). 

- Make sure you are informed on and comply with **University policies and guidance around [research integrity](https://research-office.ed.ac.uk/research-integrity)** . 

- Be aware that individual **funders may have their own policies, guidance and recommendations** around open research practices and tools, and you may have to additionally ensure you comply with these.

**Apply principles of Open Research to your work**

- Consider your options for access early in the research process, ideally before paper submission. Consider which Open Access options are available to your specific work and whether you can **share your data**. You should discuss this with your group leader.  

- Data may be published through dedicated open-access publishers or commercial publishers, who publish open-access as well as subscription-based journals. **Open Access Publishing is a requirement of many funders and [REF](https://2029.ref.ac.uk/about/how-to-get-involved/ref-2029-open-access-policy-consultation/)**.

- Ensure you comply with funders’ policies relating to **Open Access**. Many will require a **data availability statement** detailing how to access your data, software used, or other research materials underpinning your research, and you may need to deposit a copy of your paper in an external repository (e.g. Europe PMC). Some funders have sanctions for non-compliance.  

- Ensure you comply with the University’s [Publication & Copyright Policy](https://information-services.ed.ac.uk/about/policies-and-regulations/research-publications) which applies to staff on research contracts. 

- The University has systems in place to cover [Open Access publishing fees](https://library.ed.ac.uk/research-support/publish-research/open-access/read-and-publish-journals)

- Consider non-peer reviewed formats such as **preprints** to disseminate your research on an open access server, e.g., [openRxiv](https://openrxiv.org/). A preprint is a full draft research paper that is shared publicly before it has been peer-reviewed. Most preprints are given a digital object identifier (DOI) so they can be cited in other research papers. Benefits include credit, feedback and visibility.  

- Learn about **publication bias**, and consider when to publish negative findings 

- Create and use an [Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)](https://orcid.org/) and link your publications to your profile. 

- Understand author contributions using [CRediT](https://credit.niso.org/), and appropriately and fairly acknowledge all contributions to a research piece.
