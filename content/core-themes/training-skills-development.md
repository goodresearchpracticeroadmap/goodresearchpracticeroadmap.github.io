**Developing technical and transferable skills can be hugely beneficial for your current position as well as your future career path. There are many useful resources and training courses available at the University and beyond, to develop these skills.**

- Determine which skills are needed for different stages of your research project: e.g., **technical skills** (e.g., laboratory skills, coding languages), **data analysis and statistics**, **dissemination of findings** (writing, public speaking), **leadership skills**, **project management**, **teaching**.   

- Identify and participate in regular **training opportunities** that will benefit you and help you reach these goals. This could consist of IAD courses, university-wide courses, courses available publicly, paid courses (which may be reimbursable if approved by your supervisor), skills bootcamps.
