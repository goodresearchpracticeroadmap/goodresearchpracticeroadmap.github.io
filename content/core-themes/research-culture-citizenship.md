**Research culture embodies the behaviours, values, expectations, attitudes and norms that define our research communities. Positive research cultures foster an environment of integrity, collaboration, and continuous learning, which drives high-quality and ethical research. Research citizenship emphasises collaboration and community engagement which strengthens the integrity and impact of your research.**

 
Understand how negative research culture can lead to poor research practice, impair integrity and reduce reproducibility, and conversely how **good research culture** can promote **integrity and reproducibility**. 

- Understand your responsibilities as a researcher, The University of Edinburgh follows [UK Research Integrity Office's (UKRIO) Code of Practice for Research](https://research-office.ed.ac.uk/research-integrity/researcher-responsibilities) and the [Universities UK (UUK) Concordat to Support Research Integrity](https://research-office.ed.ac.uk/research-integrity/researcher-responsibilities)

- Consider **joining committees** to more actively improve research culture. This could include postgraduate and postdoctoral societies, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) committees, or local research culture groups.  

- Additional requirements and responsibilities apply to line managers or group leaders:  

  - **Promote good research culture** (e.g. [Lab handbooks](https://elifesciences.org/articles/88853) to outline the ethos of a research group, team building, supportive work environment, flexible working, good team morale).  

  - Group leaders can have an important influence on group members’ awareness and uptake of good research practices. When **supervising others**, be sure to model, actively promote, and support good research practices. For supervising students, helpful resources include the IAD Postgraduate Research Supervisors website.
